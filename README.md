In the dynamic landscape of event management and the vast number of events in our college, the need for efficient and user-friendly solutions to track, manage, and enhance event experiences is paramount. The "Event Tracking System on Android" project addresses these requirements by leveraging the power of the Android platform to create a comprehensive system for event organizers, participants, and administrators.
The system allows users to register for events seamlessly through the Android application, providing a user-friendly interface for quick and secure registration.
The Android application facilitates real-time tracking of event attendance, providing organizers with instant insights into participant numbers and engagement.
Organizers and administrators access a comprehensive dashboard to monitor event analytics, track registration data, and manage participant information.
